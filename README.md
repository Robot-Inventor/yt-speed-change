# YT Speed Change

[日本語](README_ja.md)

Save time by changing the playback speed of YouTube at well.

## What Is This?

This is a browser extension which adds a video playback speed controller to the bottom right corner of the YouTube.

You can directly enter the playback speed value in the controller, or you can use the mouse wheel to control it intuitively. You can reset the playback speed with the touch of a button. You can set to 0.1x or 4x, which is not possible with the standard YouTube playback speed setting.
